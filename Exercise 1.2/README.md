In this final exercise, i decided to use a dictionary becasue they offer key: value pairs. Each key (names, cooking_time, ingredients) all have a value that goes with them. So it made sense to start with a dictionary. Inside the dictionary I needed a list, so i could list out teh ingredients. Then finally i needed to put all the dictionaries into a large list, where i could access all of them and all of their keys or values as needed.
