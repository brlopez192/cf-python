In this section I created a cf-python-base environment
I then created an add.py file
I then installed ipython and used pip freeze to create a requirments.txt
I then installed that requirements.txt to my new cf-python-copy
i then created a repositor and new folders within my workspace to keep track of what I do. in addition to this readMe file.
